- Datasets for student projects
  - George Cowan (This is an example of the kind of information that would be appropriate. You can ask for this dataset 
    if you like, but you must also include at least one additional dataset.)
    - Example WHO cumulative Corona Virus cases by date 
      - <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset>
      - Download the datasets by clicking on the Download button under the header image. I have only looked at one of the files: 
        covid_19_data.csv. It's column descriptions can be found be expanding the Description section that is a little below 
        the download button. The file seems to be updated almost daily.
      - I think this would be an excellent dataset to explore because it is such an important topic, even though 
        it is not related to my major. Categorical fields would be Country/Region, and perhaps Province/State. 
        There are several numerical fields. Graphing the growth of cases over time for a selected state like 
        Michigan would be possible, but the date field looks different than what we have studied. I may need some help there.

     - Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Cards Dataset
        - https://www.kaggle.com/tathor/yugioh-trading-cards-dataset/data
        - YuGiOh is a card game that I have a lot of interest in and I think it would be fun to explore the most common card type or               monster attributes given the over 6,000 cards included in this data set.
     - Video Game Sales Dataset
        - https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales
        - I think this would be an interesting dataset since it details the sales in different regions of the world and can illustrate
          which games are most popular in these regions.

      - The categorical fields are City, Year, Sport, Discipline, Event, Athlete, Gender, Country_Code, Country, Event_Gender, and               Medal. I choose this dataset as my first choice even though it is not related to my major because it is interesting to see the           data for all the medals in the Summer Olympics from 1976 to 2008.
      - There are no numerical fields in this dataset.
    - World Happiness Report

      - The categorical fields are Overall Rank, Country or Region, Score, GDP per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy,             Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, and Perceptions of Corruption. Each category from GDP per Capita to Perceptions of             Corruption has a number that contributes to each country’s happiness score which ranges from 0 – 10.
      - There are no numerical fields in this dataset.
